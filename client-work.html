        <h3>Scope<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>The owner of The Good Fish wanted to revamp the website and utilize it for online orders, as well as provide information about the restaurant, menu, and contact details.</p>
        <h3>The Problems<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>With many busy customers visiting the restaurant, sometimes the queue can trail out the door. Thus, the client wanted to leverage the website to alleviate the ordering process for the customers and staff to
          increase efficiency. So, I focused on the following problems:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>“Order Online” Feature</strong> - The only way for customers to order ahead was to call the restaurant. So, having an ordering online feature would provide customers with a convenient alternative.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Image Placement</strong> - As they say, "you eat with your eyes before your mouth." When ordering food, new customers would typically like to see how the dishes look before ordering. Although the current website had a number of
            eye-catching photos, the placements of the images were not convenient for customers to view. This is a problem for customers who want to quickly see what they may potentially order.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Information Architecture</strong> - The content of the website was scattered throughout, so I sought to find an organized solution that would make it easier for users to find what they are looking for.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Refreshing Content</strong> - Most of the website's details were outdated and inaccurate with broken images and pages.</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Research Process<span class="white-period">.</span></h3>
      <p>I wanted to dive deeper into understanding customer ordering behavior and how competitors are using their website.</p>
      <h4>Key Questions<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
      <p>First, I raised key questions that can provide further insights about the customer and help with narrowing down the opportunities.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How do customers reference the menu and place an order?</li>
        <li>What helps with the decision-making of placing an order?</li>
        <li>What problems do customers face when ordering?</li>
        <li>How are competitors using their websites to have their customers order online?</li>
        <li>What are useful design patterns used at other restaurants?</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>User Research<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
      <p>I conducted interviews with customers and those that have never eaten at The Good Fish, and I discovered the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yelp</strong> is an important source of viewing the menu items and reading about what is popular. This allows them to get a better sense of (1) what the item includes, (2) how large the portion is, and (3) whether or not it will
          satisfy them.</li>
        <li><strong>Menu item descriptions</strong> are also highly important when deciding what to order. Some of the items are lacking descriptions or are inaccurate, which can frustrate the customer. They want to ensure that they are getting
          what they are looking for.</li>
        <li><strong>Previous experiences</strong> with the food items at other restaurants gives customers and potential customers a strong idea of what they like and dislike.</li>
        <li><strong>Value/Pricing</strong> is a strong influencer of deciding what to order.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality of food</strong>, particularly of the fish in this case, is a great factor when ordering. Customers use Yelp and word-of-mouth as research.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Competitive Analysis<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
      <div class="column-3">
        <div>
          <p>To understand how competitors are using their websites and identify useful existing design patterns, I created a competitive analysis of similar restaurants around the area.</p>
          <p>The main takeaways were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Most competitors did not have an "Order Online" feature.</li>
            <li>Menu items were mainly described without a supplementary image.</li>
            <li>Yelp, Instagram, and Twitter links were prevalent for customers to keep in touch and reference.</li>
            <li>Their website primary acted as an extended business card.</li>
            <li>Many competitors highlighted their quality of food with a dedicated page.</li>
            <li>The background story of the restaurant was told on the website to provide transparency and to build relationship with customers.</li>
          </ul>

    <h3>Design Process<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <h4>Solutions<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>After gathering the findings and competitve research, I concluded with the following solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Order Online” Feature</strong> - Implement an easy-to-use "Order Online" feature with strong call-to-actions throughout the website to provide multiple points of entry.</li>
      <li><strong>Image Placement</strong> - Include high quality images, port Instagram photos, and effectively place them to where customers can quickly reference and explore the food items.</li>
      <li><strong>Information Architecture</strong> - Organize the website in a methodical order for users to easily navigate.</li>
      <li><strong>Refreshing Content</strong> - Update and introduce new content that would entice customers to order online. The menu items descriptions, testimonies, background story, and quality of food were the main focuses.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, these solutions tie back to the main objective of making it easier for customers to order online, which ultimately increases efficiency for both the customer and the staff. I then developed a site map to better organize the pages,
      mapped out a user flow to clearly see the steps in order for customers to order online, and whipped up wireframes for user testing.</p>

    <h3>User Testing<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <h4>Objectives<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>I conducted live user testing and had them perform tasks on the prototype to understand the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To find out any road blocks or frustrations when ordering online.</li>
      <li>To determine design inconsistencies and usability problems throughout the website.</li>
      <li>To understand the thought process behind each user.</li>
      <li>To establish baseline user performance and user-satisfaction levels of the user interface for future usability evaluations.</li>
      <li>To identify potential design concerns to improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Testing Results<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>After running through usability testing, I found that the testers were already familiar with restaurant websites, so ordering online was “easy” for them, even among older adults. Below are further findings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>33% of users immediately went to the gallery to see what caught their attention.</li>
      <li>50% browsed through the menu before attempting to make an order.</li>
      <li>50% asked if they can use Yelp when deciding what to order</li>
      <li>83% of order online attempts were through the CTA on the global navigation because “it’s right there.”</li>
      <li>83% users were more likely to order online after learning about the feature.</li>
      <li>100% users were satisfied with their experiences. (The only concern was logging in/creating a ChowNow account. But upon further discussion, I learned that the inconvenience cost is low because they were able to also use Facebook or Google
        to log in.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With these results, it confirmed the importance of the number and quality of photos, ordering online, social media (especially Yelp), and the ease-of-use of the “Order Online” feature.</p>
