        <h3>Background<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>LA Fitness is a gym chain with more than 700 clubs across the United States. Their mission is to “provide the means and motivation for people to get as fit as they can.”
        </p>
        <h3>Scope<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>The primary goal with their app is improve the overall gym experience by reducing the friction for members to access clubs and gym information.</p>
        <p>As someone who exercises regularly at LA Fitness, I decided to set out and uncover the pain points behind the mobile app, and find any potential drop-offs where there could be opportunity.</p>
        <p>I will be focused on the users' access to
          membership cards, class reservations, cancelations, and discoverability of local gyms and class schedules.</p>

        <h3>User Research<span class="white-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>I conducted user research on participants who had never used the app before and had them do simple tasks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Access</strong> membership card
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find</strong> local gym
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View</strong> details for upcoming cycling class
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add</strong> local gym and cycling class to favorites
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reserve</strong> spot for cycling class
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancel</strong> reservation for cycling class
          </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Results<span class="white-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>Below are the main takeaways from the research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>6 / 10</strong> did not locate the membership card icon on the homepage at a glance</li>
          <li><strong>5 / 10</strong> had difficulty adding a gym and/or class to their favorites</li>
          <li><strong>4 / 10</strong> could not figure out how to cancel reservation starting from the home screen</li>
          <li><strong>3 / 10</strong> did not spot the reserve button at a glance</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>The Process<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <p>After reviewing each participant’s experience with the app, I proceeded by:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identifying the frustrations</li>
      <li>Prioritizing the issues to be tackled</li>
      <li>Mapping out the user flow when it came to searching, reserving, and favoriting a class</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This helped me get a better sense of where along the flow there were problems and if there was any relationship between them.</p>

    <h3>User Pain Points<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <p>As the research results inferred, there were several issues involving the membership card, favoriting, and reservations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accessing Membership Card</strong>: Users were unable to find the membership card icon at a glance on the home screen of the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Favoriting Gyms and Classes</strong>: There was difficulty in figuring out how to add a gym and/or class to their favorites as the call-to-action is currently unclear.</li>
      <li><strong>Making Reservations</strong>: Some users tapped on the “Reserve Now” text in the class list believing that it would sign them up for the class; however, they realized that they had to officially reserve a spot in the Class Details
        section.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Canceling Reservations</strong>: Some users had trouble finding the class reservation page from the homepage, which made it difficult for them to cancel reservations.</li>
    </ul>

          <div>
            <p><strong>Before</strong></p>
            <p>I mapped out the current user flow to pinpoint the issues from searching for classes and gyms to attending the reserved session. This clarifies where the issues occur during the process.</p>
