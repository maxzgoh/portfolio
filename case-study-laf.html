        <h3>Background<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>LA Fitness is a gym chain with more than 700 clubs across the United States. Their mission is to “provide the means and motivation for people to get as fit as they can.”
        </p>
        <h3>Scope<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>The primary goal with their app is improve the overall gym experience by reducing the friction for members to access clubs and gym information.</p>
        <p>As someone who exercises regularly at LA Fitness, I decided to set out and uncover the pain points behind the mobile app, and find any potential drop-offs where there could be opportunity.</p>
        <p>I focused on the users' access to
          membership cards, class reservations, cancelations, and discoverability of local gyms and class schedules.</p>

    <h3>User Research<span class="white-period">.</span></h3>
    <h4>App Store Reviews<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>First, I went to the App Store to see the reviews of the current LA Fitness app too get a better sense of how people are feeling about their experience with it.</p>
    <img id="laf_appstorereviews" src="img/laf_appstorereviews.png" alt="laf_appstorereviews">
    <p>With an overall rating of 2.3 out of 5 with 1,259 reviews, the app seems to have a long way to go in terms of pleasing its users.</p>
    <div class="column-3-critiques">
      <div>
        <p>"My issue - and it is not small IMHO - is how unbelievably terrible the reserve a fitness class part is. Classes are basically never available 24 hours in advance. Somtimes it gives you a blue link to register that actually does nothing."

        <p>"My biggest complaint is that I go to the same location every day. WHen I want to look up the class schedule for my location I have to choose it from a map or list. It should allow me to set a default location that comes up and shows the
          class
          list."<p>- Boxer Lola</p>

        <p>"The user interface is convoluted and unnecessarily difficult. Searching for your location is a laborious process. It's ugly."<p>- Electronicchild</p>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The main issues from current users appear to be around reserving and favoriting classes, not being able to set default location, search funcationality, and the "convoluted" user interface.</p>
    <p>With this feedback in mind, I decided to also conduct a usability test to confirm and uncover the pain points that exist in the app.</p>
    <div class="column-3">
      <div>
        <h4>Usability Test<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
        <p>The usability tests were conducted on participants who had never used the app before, and I had them do simple tasks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Access</strong> membership card
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find</strong> local gym
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View</strong> details for upcoming cycling class
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add</strong> local gym and cycling class to favorites
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reserve</strong> spot for cycling class
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancel</strong> reservation for cycling class
          </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Results<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
        <p>Below are the main takeaways from the research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>6 / 10</strong> did not locate the membership card icon on the homepage at a glance</li>
          <li><strong>5 / 10</strong> had difficulty adding a gym and/or class to their favorites</li>
          <li><strong>4 / 10</strong> could not figure out how to cancel reservation starting from the home screen</li>
          <li><strong>3 / 10</strong> did not spot the reserve button at a glance</li>

    <h3>The Process<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <p>After reviewing each participant’s experience with the app, I proceeded by identifying the frustrations, and creating the user flow when it came to searching, reserving, and favoriting a class. This helped me get a better sense of where along
      the flow there were problems and if there was any relationship between them.</p>
    <h4>User Pain Points<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>As the research results inferred, there were several issues involving the following:</p>
    <div class="column-4a">
      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Accessing Membership Card</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>Users were unable to find the membership card icon at a glance on the home screen of the app. The order of the bottons do not seem like they are in any particular
          order. It is difficult to find the membership card at a glance due to the arrangement of the buttons. When entering the gym, users may take more time to access their membership card, which slows down the check-in process.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img id="laf_membershipcard" src="img/laf_membershipcard.png" alt="laf_membershipcard">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Favoriting Gyms and Classes</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>There was difficulty in figuring out how to add a gym and/or class to their favorites as the call-to-action is currently unclear. In order to favorite the gym/club, the user must tap on the heart icon; hoever, the users may not be able to
          recognize that this icon is the action to favorite the club because it is aligned with unactionable icons.</p>

    <div class="column-4b">
      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Making Reservations</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>Some users tapped on the “Reserve Now” text in the class list believing that it would sign them up for the class; however, they realized that they had to officially reserve a spot in the Class Details section. The users are unable to view
          availability of open spots, and reserve a spot in the list view.</p>
      </div>
      <div>

      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Canceling Reservations</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>Some users had trouble finding the class reservation page from the homepage, which made it difficult for them to cancel reservations. After the user reserves a spot for class, the reservation icon appears on the top right of the home
          screen. Although the app highlights the new icon after reserving a spot, the message is only shown once. Thus, users may not be aware of the change, which makes it difficult for them to cancel their spot.</p>
