        <h3>Background<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>LA Fitness is a gym chain with more than 700 clubs across the United States. Their mission is to “provide the means and motivation for people to get as fit as they can.”
        </p>
        <h3>Scope<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>The goal with their app is improve the overall gym experience by providing conveniences for accessing gym and membership information.</p>
        <p>As someone who exercises regularly at LA Fitness, I decided to set out and uncover the pain points behind the mobile app, and find any potential drop-offs where there could be opportunity.</p>

    <h4>App Store Reviews<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>First, I went to the App Store to see the reviews of the current LA Fitness app to get a better sense of how people are feeling about their experiences with it.</p>

        </p>

    </div>
    <p>The main issues from current users appear to be around reserving and favoriting classes, not being able to <strong>set a default location</strong>, <strong>search funcationality</strong>, and the <strong>"convoluted" user interface.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>With this feedback in mind, I decided to also conduct a usability test to confirm and uncover more possible pain points that exist in the app.</p>
    <div class="column-3">
      <div>
        <h4>Usability Test<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
        <p>The usability tests were conducted on participants who had never used the app before, and I had them do simple tasks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Access</strong> membership card
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find</strong> local gym
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View</strong> details for upcoming cycling class
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add</strong> cycling class to favorites
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reserve</strong> spot for cycling class
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancel</strong> reservation for cycling class
          </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Results<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
        <p>Below are the main takeaways from the test:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>6 / 10</strong> did not locate the membership card icon on the homepage at a glance</li>
          <li><strong>5 / 10</strong> had difficulty adding the cycling class to their favorites</li>
          <li><strong>4 / 10</strong> could not figure out how to cancel reservation starting from the home screen</li>
          <li><strong>3 / 10</strong> did not spot the reserve button at a glance</li>

    <h3>The Process<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <p>After assessing the online reviews and each research participant’s experience with the app, I proceeded by identifying the main frustrations, and creating the current user flow of performing the tasks from searching for classes to attending
      the class in person. This helped me clarify what I needed to focus on, and get a better sense of where along the path there were problems.</p>
    <h4>User Pain Points<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>As the research results inferred, there were several issues involving the following:</p>
    <div class="column-4a">
      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Accessing Membership Card</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>Users were unable to find the membership card icon at a glance on the home screen of the app. The order of the bottons do not seem like they are in any particular
          order. It is difficult to find the membership card at a glance due to the arrangement of the buttons. When entering the gym, users may take more time to access their membership card, which slows down the check-in process.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img id="laf_membershipcard" src="img/laf_membershipcard.png" alt="laf_membershipcard">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Favoriting Classes</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>There was difficulty in figuring out how to add a gym and/or class to their favorites as the call-to-action is currently unclear. In order to favorite the gym/club, the user must tap on the heart icon; however, the users may not be able to
          recognize that this icon is the action to favorite the club because it is aligned with unactionable icons.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img id="laf_clubdetails" src="img/laf_clubdetails.png" alt="laf_laf_clubdetails">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="column-4b">
      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Making Reservations</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>Some users tapped on the “Reserve Now” text in the class list believing that it would sign them up for the class; however, they realized that they had to officially reserve a spot in the Class Details section. The users are unable to view
          availability of open spots, and reserve a spot in the list view.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img id="laf_reservation" src="img/laf_reservation.png" alt="laf_reservation">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Canceling Reservations</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>Some users had trouble finding the class reservation page from the homepage, which made it difficult for them to cancel reservations. After the user reserves a spot for class, the reservation icon appears on the top right of the home
          screen. Although the app highlights the new icon after reserving a spot, the message is only shown once. Thus, users may not be aware of the change, which makes it difficult for them to cancel their spot.</p>

      <div>
        <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Setting Default Gym Location</strong></span>:</p>
        <p>Users have no way of setting a default gym location for their main club. When they want to look up the class schedule, they would have to repeat the gym selection process each time.</p>

    <h3>Solutions<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <h4><span class="black-bold">Accessing Membership Card</span><span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>To make it easier for users to access their Membership Card when checking into the gym, I placed a "My Account" icon in the global bar below the screen and another access point in the menu.</p>
    <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Before</strong></span></p>

    <h4><span class="black-bold">Favoriting Classes</span><span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>I added a Favorites icon in the bottom global bar for users to quickly find their favorited classes. I also placed "My Favorites" to the menu to provide a second entry point to their favorites. Additionally, I added a clear message to the "My
      Favorites" screen when no classes have been favored along with a call-to-action to see the class schedules.</p>
    <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Before</strong></span></p>
    <img class="final-mocks" id="laf_2a" src="img/laf_2a.png" alt="laf_2a">
    <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>After</strong></span></p>
    <img class="final-mocks" id="laf_2b" src="img/laf_2b.png" alt="laf_2b">
    <h4><span class="black-bold">Making Reservations</span><span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>With the redesign, users are able to reserve their spot in the list view of the classes and they are able to also view the availablity without entering into the class details. After reserving a spot, the app will take them to the "My
      Reservation" to see their current reservations in case the user would like to immediately cancel.</p>
    <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Before</strong></span></p>

    <h4><span class="black-bold">Canceling Reservations</span><span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>Users can now simply cancel their reservations by selecting on "My Reservations" in the menu. This is clearer than the biking icon on the home screen as users were unable to locate it with the previous design. Also, I added a "Reservation
      Canceled" modal upon confirming cancelation to provide verification that the spot has been canceled.</p>

    <h4><span class="black-bold">Setting Default Gym Location</span><span class="yellow-period">.</span></h4>
    <p>Based on the user research, users wanted to be able to set their default gym location to avoid repeating the same actions to find their gym details and classes that they frequent. Thus, users are now able to set a primary location by tapping
      either on the "Class Schedules" or "Find Clubs" components on the home screen. Primary locations can also be changed in "My Clubs" in the menu.</p>
    <p><span class="black-bold"><strong>Before</strong></span></p>
    <p>There was no feature to set a default gym location.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion<span class="white-period">.</span></h3>
    <p>The solutions for the issues around the membership card, favoriting classes, making reservations, canceling reservations, and setting a default gym location solves a handful of the users' pain points, which ultimately betters the experience
      and increases the favorability of the app. The next steps are to improve the design of favoriting gyms, signing up for personal training, accessing guest passes, and tracking personal performance.</p>
