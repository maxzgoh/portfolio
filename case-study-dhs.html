        <h3>Scope<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>With a plethora of information and topics handled by the DHS, I sought to improve the architecture, brand, and design of their site to allow increase usage, favorability, and ease-of-use for visitors. My main focus was
          the user interface, branding, navigation, and content strategy.</p>
        <h3>Brand Voice<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
        <p>The objective was to refresh the interface brand by highlighting the voice of strength, security, and responsibility while introducing additional undertones of simplicity and modernity through redesigning the website. I wanted to
          provide clean, purposeful, and modern design to increase consideration, usage, and overall satisfaction for users of all age groups. I focused on the homepage as it is the first point that users visit.</p>

        <p>I started to browse the website and I noticed that the content was a bit scattered. There were articles that were placed into topics that did not best describe the information. So I created a site map with clearer topics of information
          that would make it more intuitive and easier for users to navigate and find articles that they are looking for.</p>

    <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <p>After rearranging the information architecture and redlining the homepages, I drafted wireframes for all devices with the goal making information clearer and more accessible for all users.</p>
    <p><span class="black-text"><strong>Global Sticky Navigation</strong></span>: I introduced a global
      sticky navigation with helpful
      icons for users to begin looking for information at any point of the website.</p>
    <p><span class="black-text"><strong>Search Bar</strong></span>: Also, the search bar is front and center of the hero image so users can quickly type in key words or questions that they would like answered. This shortens the time
      spent clicking through all the pages to find the content that the user is looking for.</p>
    <p><span class="black-text"><strong>More Specific Naming of Topics</strong></span>: To provide further ease of use, I created new names for the topics and call-to-actions that would better represent the information.</p>

    <h3>User Testing<span class="white-period">.</span></h3>
    <div class="column-5">
      <div>
        <h4>Objectives<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
        <p>I set up a user test plan after designing the initial wireframes and set up the following test objectives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To determine design inconsistencies and usability problem areas within the navigation menu.</li>
          <li>To exercise website under controlled test conditions with participants.</li>
          <li>To establish baseline user performance and user-satisfaction levels of the user interface for future usability evaluations.</li>
          <li>To identify potential design concerns to improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Tasks<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
        <p>Below are the instructions provided during the test.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Find the "Join Frequent Travelers Program" page on current website.</li>
          <li>Provide the reason why they chose to use their chosen method to search for the news page</li>
          <li>Find the "Join Frequent Travelers Program" page on clickable prototype.</li>
          <li>Provide the reason why they chose to use their chosen method to search for the news page</li>
          <li>Give open opinion about the nagivation experience between the two websites.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Results<span class="white-period">.</span></h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1/5</strong> of testers immediately used the search bar to type in "Join Frequent Travelers Program" in the prototype.</li>
      <li><strong>4/5</strong> of testers were able to find the "Join Frequent Travelers Program" page without any detours on the current website versus 100% for the prototype.</li>
      <li><strong>5/5</strong> of testers preferred more specific navigation bar selections, such as "For Travelers", compared to the "How Do I?" (current website) call-to-action.</li>
      <li><strong>5/5</strong> of testers felt that the prototype was better structured than the current.</li>
      <li><strong>5/5</strong> of testers liked the drop down menu feature in the prototype because they were able to view their sections before clicking on a selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on the results, it appears that (1) the placement of the search bar became a stronger option for users, (2) specific topics in the global navigation bar were helpful for users to find what they are looking for, (3) the new layout and
      content structure was more understandable for users, (4) and drop down menus bettered their search experience.</p>

        <p>Once I completed the user testing and made adjustments to the wireframes based on the results, I then created a style guide to keep the interface elements consistent. The colors were inspired by the DHS emblem and we decided to use the
          navy blue as one of the
          primary colors to respresent patriotism and strength.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion<span class="yellow-period">.</span></h3>
    <p>The goals of the redesign tackled the issues around usability, branding, navigation, and information architecture. The interface was redesigned for users to more easily navigate through the pages. Moreover, the brand voice of strength,
      security, and
      responsibility were exemplified through the new style guide, reinforcing their identity while providing a clean and modern look. Lastly, the navigation and reorganization of the content ultimately helped users search for what they were looking
      for within the library of information that this government website holds.</p>
    <p>As this was more of a user interface focused study, the next steps would be to tackle more user pain points during searching and figuring methods to reduce the number of clicks to find the content that the visitor is searching.</p>
